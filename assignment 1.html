    1.   Find the distance between the following pairs of points:

        (i)   (2,3),(4,1)
        (ii)  (-5,7),(-1,3)
        (iii) (a,b),(-a,-b)

        <b>Solution:</b>

        (i)    We know that the distance between two points (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>) is 
                given by,
                (x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
                Hence, the distance between (2,3) and (4,1) is given by,
                Distance = (2-4)<sup>2</sup> + (3-1)<sup>2</sup> = (-2)<sup>2</sup>+(2)<sup>2</sup> = 4 + 4 = 8
                = 2sqroot2
                    
        (ii)   We know that the distance between two points (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>) is 
                given by,
                (x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
                Hence, the distance between (-5,7) and (-1,3) is given by,
